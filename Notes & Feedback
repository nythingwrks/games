FEEDBACK:

Simon test play:
  -> Maybe gun ending is not a complete ending?
  -> unclear on how to get more info for the riddle
  -> not clear which joke to tell the donkey, because simon had the shell then he defaulted to telling the dark joke 
    But ACTUALLY: he did go back and try different jokes but the hint wasnt clear! Simon told the existential joke and didnt understand that the answer was a hint , so just kept ending up shooting the stationmaster 
  - Can we build something in to make the player only clock how to do the gun ending  upon a second play through.
  - OR flesh out the gun ending? He said it felt unsatisfying.





NOTES/QUESTIONS for testplayers:

1. Need a 'turn back' before the station master launches into riddle?`

DEBUGGING:
we've checked that viewing the info board multiple times works regardless of whether you got bitten by the rabbit.
