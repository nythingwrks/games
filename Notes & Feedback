Fred & Nell 19/02/26:
- Shortcut between monastery and station house
- rewarding repetition and time: more variation on e path ? once you've visited the grove more than 10(?) times something appears there? 
- READ THROUGH and amend game in line with this: Perspective, our character is largely a blank canvas ( has forgotten who they are) that the player can project on to.
    However- fun to have moments (e.g. confessions) that give the player a glimpse of who the character may be.
- if you choose not to put the shell in the gap, does the option still stay to do that if you have the shell and come back to the slab a second/third time?
- Add option to have the Station Master repeat riddle in abridged form (freddie doing this)

COMPARING ENDINGS:
THE BAD ENDING = Gun ending
- should be unsatisfying and violent (that's the point) 
- thus there should be slightly icky BUT easy vibe to the steps to getting the gun.
EDITS:  Should be able to shoot her immediately without riddle.
        INSTEAD of a joke, you do something violent (but inconsequential) in front of it and it laughs and gives you the gun. (NO LONGER linked to the joking).

CHAOTIC GOOD: STAY
You should have the choice to be buddy buddy with the SM. Choosing to do so doesnt create a conditional choice, but does subvert your expectations of her and make you more likely to stay. 

NEUTRAL GOOD: LEAVE -> TRUE LEAVE and FALSE LEAVE (RETURN)
true leave: have to earn through gameplay otherwise you get false leave.


OBSCURE LORE ENDING: RABBIT
