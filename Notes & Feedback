FEEDBACK:

Simon test play:
  -> Maybe gun ending is not a complete ending?
  -> unclear on how to get more info for the riddle
  -> not clear which joke to tell the donkey, because simon had the shell then he defaulted to telling the dark joke 
    But ACTUALLY: he did go back and try different jokes but the hint wasnt clear! Simon told the existential joke and didnt understand that the answer was a hint , so just kept ending up shooting the stationmaster 
  - Can we build something in to make the player only clock how to do the gun ending  upon a second play through.
  - OR flesh out the gun ending? He said it felt unsatisfying.
Riddle: Simon gathered the green king had the crown and was killed, that the king w the goblet is killed, but not the characters of the kings or the association between red/goblet (or alternatively middle/goblet) and black/sword
-> stained glass add colour + object info, the player would see the colour of their robes and what their holding so its not fair to hold 
-> station felt modern, the middle-aged monastery feels very disconnected which obviously does have a lore reason. Every ending should leav ethe player with SOME level of lore understanding of the world, its history and relationships between characters.
More obscure endings can embellish this. 

-> other option: make gun ending much shorter and more obviously a gag
-> rabbit ending: change is not noticeable, maybe wording right after the bite shouldnt be "dont touch wild animals", and then the hints that things have changed for you after being bitten should be stronger.
Maybe all small rabbit like changes should be conditional on "pet", not "board secret".


NELL NOTES:
1. returning to stain glass window should remind you of colours/objects or positions. Same with shell message. I vote positions, as the fact that you're looking at the window head on means the player has to flip the direction anyway. 
2. Blood staining reen silk doesnt actually imply he was killed, he could also be the killer or near someone killed.
3. Should be able to ask the station madster to repeat the whole riddle (or at least an abridged version).
4. BUG(?): If you tell the donkey an existential joke you lose the ability to tell him a dark one and unlock the gun. 
Ideas: main path is staying there. Leaving should be conditional on something sneaky or hidden about mid way through the game. Also makes players less likely to lean into te gun ending?


NOTES/QUESTIONS for testplayers:

1. Need a 'turn back' before the station master launches into riddle?`

DEBUGGING:
we've checked that viewing the info board multiple times works regardless of whether you got bitten by the rabbit.
