You open the door to see a modest waiting room, muffled by a thick layer of dust. One of the back windows is broken and through it the forest has begun to reclaim the space.

A figure stands in the middle of the room, wearing an immaculate double-breasted coat. Her name badge reads "STATION MASTER".

==conversation
You clear your throat.
* [Say hello] 
You begin to introduce yourself, but realise your name has slipped right out of your mind. 
** [Tell her you are lost]
"Good Afternoon, Lost. I'm the station master, how may I be of service?" She replies, unblinking.
***[Correct her] You tell her your name isn't 'Lost', that it's just what you are.
"Oh, of course. I'm sorry."

****[...]
She doesn't look particularly sorry. 
*****[Ask her name]
She pauses. "Station master is fine."
*****[Ask her to help you] 
She cocks her head. 
"You may have to be a little bit more specific. Anything to do with this station, probably yes. However, if you were in dire need of a buttermilk pancake or were bleeding out, I'd probably struggle a little bit.{ critter: That bite of yours does look painful, though I doubt it'll scar.| But I don't think you're in any danger of that happening.}" 
 
*** [Ask how to leave the forest]
"I've long since forgotten the route on foot, but there's certainly a train that could take you to your destination." 
** [Tell her you are looking for the station master]
"That would be me," she taps her name badge with a well-manicured fingernail. "How can I help you?"

- She smiles but it doesn't quite reach her eyes. You can't tell how old she is. 

*[Ask when the next train is]
*[Ask where you are] You ask where you both are,  suddenly aware of your own ignorance.
"The train station, of course." She finally blinks. 
**[Press further] You ask her where the train station is.
"In the forest. You must have seen the trees, surely." You feel like this line of questioning isn't going to lead you anywhere.
***[Ask when the next train is]
- She seems faintly amused. "That depends on where you want to go. We have an information board outside with routes and times."
*[I want to leave the forest]
*{information_board} [I've already been there.] You tell her it was unhelpful.
"I'm sorry to hear that. I'll talk to someone about updating it." 
You don't think she will.  
**[Ask her how to leave the forest]
*{not information_board} [I haven't looked at it yet.] You admit you came straight to talk to her.
"I see. No bother, I know its contents better than most."
**[Ask how to leave the forest]
- "Ah. Trains <i>out</i> of the woods." The stationmaster thinks for a moment. "I could tell you, but..."
*[But?]
Her blank eyes take on a glint of mischief. "Well, I'm rather enjoying having the company... I'd be sad to lose it. What would I gain by helping you leave?"
***[Ask what she wants.]
- "Actually, I might find it in me to help you if you help me first. An old man passed through a short while ago and told me a story that I can't make head or tails of..." She looks at you expectantly.

* [Let her speak]
* [Tell her you don't have time for this] She continues, ignoring you completely. 

- "Let's see if I remember it..." 

*[...]

- <i>Many years ago, this forest was once the site of an ancient kingdom.</i>

<i>The king, on his deathbed, bequeathed his three sons each equal part of the kingdom and gifted each an item from his imperial regalia.</i>

*[A foolish decision]

- <i>Three thrones were set in place at the royal court, and for a while the brothers ruled peacefully,  side by side.</i>

*[But peace can only last so long...]

- <i>One day, a  man with a donkey entered the court seeking the brothers’ counsel. Each king sat resplendent in his signature colour, one in red, one in black and one in green.</i>

*[Easy enough to tell them apart]

- <i>There are many accounts of what happened that day, but all agree on the following: Firstly, the man spoke in a low voice,</i> 

*[Why was he there?]

- <i>The most cunning king in red leaned back and paused in contemplation. From the left, the black-robed king leapt up and made as if to strike the man. The final brother, in green, adjusted his crown nervously.</i>  

*[What did he say?]

- <i>The donkey at the old man’s side let out a long braying laugh, shattering the tense silence.</i>

*[What made the donkey laugh?]

- <i>At once, the king who had been gifted the imperial sword drew it and ran the brother next to him through. </i>
<i>The remaining king stood wide-eyed, looking over his slain brother’s body at the king with the sword. Unable to believe his own brother capable of such betrayal, he could not imagine the same fate would befall him. </i>

<i>His expression remained fixed in disbelief as his head fell from his body. </i>   

*[Why would brother betray brother?]

- <i>Two clattering sounds rang out, first the goblet, and then the crown. The king with the sword took the crown from where it lay, and lifted his other brother's goblet to toast the man as he led his donkey out of the castle and into the woods.</i>

*[As it always does, it ends with the woods]

- The station master opens her eyes. You don't remember her closing them. 

"And there it is. I'm sure you understand the pickle I'm in. I can't for the life of me figure out which brother did it. He had the sword obviosuly, but other than that it's a mystery. If you could figure out the answer to my little conundrum, I would be more than happy to tell you about your departing train." 

*[Acquiese...begrudgingly]
"Splendid!
*[Ask once more when your train is arriving]
"It shouldn't take that long. I can tell you right now that you have plenty of time before your train arrives to figure out the answer.
*[Ask if you have any choice in the matter]
"I'm not sure I know what you mean.

As you move to get away from this strange woman, she offers you some words of advice.

*[...]
Her face lights up in a smile.

"Yes, of course. That makes perfect sense. But what did the man say? And why did the donkey laugh?"

She grins at your expression{riddle_wrong>4: before dropping her magazine onto a nearby chair | taking out her pocketwatch} and moving towards you.

"{not approach_donkey and riddle_wrong<4:Somone as ingenious and discerning as youself would know the answer to this, but alas, | Questions for another time, perhaps.} I believe you have a train to catch. It should be arriving any second now. For furture reference it's the half-past train that takes you out of the woods."

You hear a rumbling faintly coming from behind the door.

**[Go outside - to freedom!]

You burst out the door of the waiting room, onto the platfrom and see - 

***[What?]
***[A train, surely]

-...

*[What do I see?]

-You are alone on the platform aside from the figure of the station master, still doing who knows what in the waiting room and, of course, the information board.

*[Inspect the information board] As you move towards the board
*[Go through the door] As you make to head back inside
*[Go back] As you make to leave

- <> the stationmaster pokes her head out of the doorway. 

"Hm. Well, you know how trains are. Should be here shortly. I've never heard of a delay longer than two hours. They often just cancel them in that case."

She smiles unhelpfully. There's only one thing to do now.

*[Wait] You sink down onto the ground and put your head in your hands. You're not sure how long you'll be stuck here.
*[Complain] "Well I can't do anything about it, can, I? I'm just the stationmaster, I don't control the trains." You swear you see her wink.

-"Tell you what, I've got a deck of cards. We can pass the time together."

*[Wait]

-The stationmaster teaches you a complicated card game called 'Usurpation' that requires you to keep the black and red kings as far from each toher as possible. You teach her gin rummy.{riddle_wrong<1 and not approach_donkey: You beat her soundly at both and she sulks for a minute or two, clearly not used to losing | She beats you viciously at both}.

*[Wait]

-After a while the stationmaster bustles off to her mysterious lodgings and returns with a tray of iced tea and buttermilk pancakes. You sit and have a lovely chat about birds. 

You can see a dot on the railtracks to your left in the far distance. 

*[Wait]

-You get up to inspect the information board and the stationmaster follows you. She begins to explain how to interpret the map {not approach_donkey:and you find that you can {riddle_wrong<4:quite easily interpret it. Knowing what you know now, you shall have to retrun to the stationhouse for tea and card games again. |somewhat interpret it, though you have to sit down after a while as you head begins to spin and your vision blurs} |{riddle_wrong<4: and you can't begin to interpret it at all.

The dot has grown somewhat bigger.

*[Wait]

-You have a small sleep on one of the - surprsingly comfortable - benches in the waiting room. The stationmaster promises to wake you when your train is close. 

Before you lie down, you see that the dot is nearly double its original size.

*[Nap]

-You feel a rumbling again and wake to the stationmaster telling you that your train is nearly here. 

*[Leap to your feet]

- It's dusk in the forest, and the shadows have grown deeper, though this is nicely offset by the orange underglow of the setting sun. 

Your train is just pulling into the station as you emerge from the waiting room - the dying light plays nicely off of its red caboose. It screeches to a halt and a wood panelled door aligns itself perfectly infront of you. 

There is a pause, one in which no one exits the train, but one can get on it. 

*[Stay] You turn around and find that you cannot bring yourself to get onto the train. ->stay_end
*[Go] You reach for the door and open it, embarking on your erstwhile journey out of the woods. ->go_end

==stay_end

The stationmaster stands behind you.

"One last farewell?"

You explain to her that, for some reason, you don't want to leave.

"I'll be flattered and believe that to be about my company." Her face hides an emotion that you don't think you recognise.

*You wonder if it is.

Whatever the case - be it the serenity of {enter_mon: the monastery| the woods}, the cosiness of the stationhouse, or just the escape from a life outside you can't remember, you know that you wish to stay. For now, at least.

"Luckily for you, I have a spare room. I'll get you settled in and we can wake up bright and early tomorrow with pancakes. I have some jobs that you can do while you're with me."

The stationmaster takes you by the shoulders and leads you away from the edge of the platform as the train pulls away into the setting sun.

-> END

==go_end

You turn around and wave at the stationmaster who waves back. 

"It was lovely having you here. Hopefully I'll see you again soon?"

You agree, though with the caveat that it be under more willing circumstances.

*[Go further into the train]

-Blessedly, the train is fairly empty, and you easily find a carriage to yourself. As you sink down onto the plush upholstery of the seating, you turn to the window and look out onto the platform. 

The stationmaster busies herself clearing away the detritus the pair of you left and only turns as the train begins to pull away. You give her a wave that she returns and soon find yourself speeding through the forest at night. 

*[Dream]

<i>Three children in red and green and black. They fight over something that you can't quite make out. A figure in the corner laughs, a heavy, braying laugh. All is then lost amongst the trees.</i>

You are roused from your slumber from a familiar looking man, who, through your groginess, you realise is the ticketmaster. 

You smile and reach into your pocket before realsing that you never actually bothered to buy a ticket. Bother. 


-> END
